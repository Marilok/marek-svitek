	- just stare deeply into her eyes like you want to say something, but are holding the thought back. 
- You smell great”, “I like the fabric of your shirt”, “You have really nice eyes, did I ever say that before? From this close, it sparkles”
- Whispering something intimate like “I wish there weren’t so many people around us…,” or “you smell so good it’s driving me crazy” with some heavy breathing in the background will make the hair on the back of her neck tingle, in a good way.
- Whisper but dont be funny
- Dip
- Hug from behind
- Gaze into her eyes. No! Gaze into her soul.
- Good girl

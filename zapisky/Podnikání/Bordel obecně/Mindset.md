**All news is good news - don't ignore the bad news**
- Good news - yay
- Bad news - yay, we learned something

**Work like a lion, not like a cow**
- Cow
	- Everyday the same thing
	- 9 to 5, Monday to Friday
- Lion
	- Lions sit. wait. observe. looking for their prey.
	- When they see it. They SPRINT. Hunt. Catch.
	- EAT. enjoy. celebrate.
	- Rest. Relax.
	- Wait for the next juicy prey
- High intensity, focused on high value projects, frequent breaks to rest and recover.

**Build an audience**
- It's easier to start projects, get contacts, info...

**Don't sell saddles**
- If you’re operating in a new/niche market, promote the lifestyle, not your product

**Plateaus - getting unstuck**
1. Relax. Plateaus are always a part of growth curves.
2. Get to the right state of mind (music, movement, reframe it...)
3. Questions
	1. What does the data actually say is happening?
	2. What is the stupidly obvious thing I haven’t tried yet?
	3. What would a friend or mentor of mine do in this scenario?
	4. What is a 20% tweak I could make that would make a 100% difference?
	5. Who’s already successfully doing this? What the heck are they doing differently?
	6. Who are 3 smart people i can talk to on the phone to help me problem solve this?
4. Impatience with action, Patience with results
